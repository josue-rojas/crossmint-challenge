# CrossMint Challenge

## Requirements
Node Version 21 (this project uses nvm to switch easier to this version, you can use `nvm use`)

## Init
Clone this repo then run

```bash
# to install packages
npm ci
```

``` bash
# copy env file and fill out variables
cp .env.example .env
```
*CANDIDATE_ID is your candidate id from the email from crossmint*

Finally run the application 
``` bash
npm run start
```

## Notes
- phase 1 is commented it out on the main function. you can uncomment it to run it. but probably could use phase 2 to have the same effect.
